# What is a server?

A server is a specialized computer or 
software system designed to provide services, 
resources, or data to other computers, 
known as clients, over a network.
Servers can serve various purposes,
including hosting websites, storing files, managing emails,
providing access to databases, and more.
They are typically more powerful and have more storage capacity than regular desktop computers.
